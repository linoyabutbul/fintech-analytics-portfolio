# FinTech A/B Testing – Activation Funnel Optimization

This project analyzes an A/B test performed on a realistic dataset of 50,000 FinTech users.  
The goal was to measure the impact of a new onboarding flow (Version B) on key activation metrics:
- Signup completion  
- Deposit rate  
- First transaction rate  


# Key Results

# Signup Conversion
- **A:** 9.96%  
- **B:** 14.37%  
- **Lift:** +44.1%

# Deposit Rate
- **A:** 3.91%  
- **B:** 5.99%  
- **Lift:** +53.2%

# First Transaction Rate
- **A:** 2.13%  
- **B:** 3.44%  
- **Lift:** +62.3%

All improvements were tested for statistical significance using a Z-test:

- **Signup p-value:** 1.8984e-51  
- **Deposit p-value:** 9.37446e-27  
- **First Transaction p-value:** 3.06639e-19  

**Conclusion:** Version B significantly improves activation throughout the funnel.


## 🧠 Business Insights

- Deposit and transaction rates increase substantially, indicating stronger early engagement.  
- Statistically significant results show the uplift is *not random*.  
- Releasing Version B would likely improve LTV, monetization, and CAC payback.
